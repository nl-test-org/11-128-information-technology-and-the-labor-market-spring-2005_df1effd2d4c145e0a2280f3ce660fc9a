Description
-----------

In this course, we will explore how information technology is reshaping different dimensions of the U.S. labor market: the way work is organized, the mix of occupations, the skills required to perform in an occupation, economy-wide labor productivity, and the distribution of wages.

Much of our analysis begins from the following ideas:

*   All human work - designing a circuit, tasting a sauce, hammering a nail - involves processing information.
*   Computers are much better at some kinds of information processing than others.
*   Once we understand the kinds of information processing computers can and cannot do well, we can identify those areas of work where computers can **substitute** for human labor (eliminating jobs) and those areas of work where computers **complement** human labor (creating new jobs in many cases). We can also identify the human skills that remain valuable in the computerized workplace.

Grading
-------

| Activities | percentages |
| --- | --- |
| Periodic Problem Sets | 20% |
| Mid-term | 20% |
| Final Exam | 35% |
| Paper (20 pages) | 25% 

  

Grading will be based on periodic problem sets, a mid-term, a final exam and a 20-page paper. Each paper will be written by a pair of students and will describe how a computer might eliminate or enhance (substitute or complement) a job that is currently performed by humans.
